                        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
                        <p>This monitors how people use our site – for example the browser they use and the pages they visit. It’s
                            used to assess our website’s performance and to help us plan improvements.</p>


                        <p><strong>DoubleClick / Sizmek</strong></p>
                        <p>You may notice that sometimes after visiting our site you see increased numbers of adverts from us. This
                            is because we pay for these adverts, and the technology to do this is made possible by this cookie. We
                            use these adverts to encourage you to come back to our site. Don’t worry - we are unable to proactively
                            reach out to you as the whole process is entirely anonymised. These help us understand how well our
                            online adverts are encouraging browsers to view more
                            information about particular events on HairsprayTheMusical.co.uk and when an advert is displayed
                            on a third-party website, a Sizmek / Doubleclick cookie is placed on their machine, providing this
                            is enabled by their browser settings. If that browser then visits HairsprayTheMusical.co.uk, we
                            can see that the advert has been effective. More information about Sizmek’s or Doubleclick’s own

                            way to DoubleClick / Sizmek it allows us to reduce our costs (and keep our prices low) by using digital

                        <p><strong>Session</strong></p>
                        <p>This cookie is a transient cookie (it is erased when you close the browser). It acts as a small amount
                            of memory to remember what you’ve done on past pages.

                        <p><strong>Granting us permission to use cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>If the settings on your software that you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to
                            accept cookies we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this.
                            Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below; however,
                            doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.</p>
                        <p><strong>Our own cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>We use cookies to make our website work including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remembering your search settings</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Third party functions</strong></p>
                        <p>Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an
                            embedded YouTube video. Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third
                            parties.</p>
                        <p><strong>Social website cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>So you can easily “like” or share our content on the likes of Facebook and Twitter we have included
                            sharing buttons on our site.</p>
                        <p>The privacy implications of this will vary depending on the social network and will be dependent on the
                            privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anonymous visitor statistics cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type
                            of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows, which helps to identify when our site isn’t working
                            as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc.
                            This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called “analytics” programs also tell us if,
                            on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have
                            been here before; this helps us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of
                            marketing spend.</p>
                        <p><strong>We use advertising cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>Cookies are widely used in online advertising. Neither us, advertisers or our advertising partners can
                            gain personally identifiable information from these cookies. We only work with advertising partners who
                            work to accepted privacy standards such as <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice" target="_blank"
                               rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice</a></p>
                        <p>You can learn more about online advertising at http://www.youronlinechoices.com . You can opt-out of
                            almost all advertising cookies at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices although we would
                            prefer that you didn’t, as ultimately advertising helps keep much of the internet free. It is also worth
                            noting that opting out of advertising cookies will not mean you won’t see adverts, just simply that they
                            won’t be tailored to you any longer.</p>
                        <p><strong>We use:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>DoubleClick – privacy policy owned by Google; Sizmek – privacy policy owned by Sizmek</li>
                            <li>Remarketing cookies</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You may notice that sometimes after visiting a site you see increased numbers of adverts from the site
                            you visited. This is because advertisers, including ourselves, pay for these adverts. The technology to
                            do this is made possible by cookies and as such we may place a so called “remarketing cookie” during
                            your visit. We use these adverts to offer special offers etc to encourage you to come back to our site.
                            Don’t worry - we are unable to proactively reach out to you as the whole process is entirely
                            anonymised. You can opt out of these cookies at any time as explained above.</p>
                        <p><strong>Managing cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. You can easily control and disable cookies through
                            your browser settings.</p>

                        <p>You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies.
                            Doing so, however, will likely limit the functionality of this site - and a large proportion of
                            the world’s websites - as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites.</p>
                        <p>Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about
