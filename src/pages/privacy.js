                        <strong>What Does This Policy Cover?</strong>
                        <p>We process your personal information gathered on this website in order to tailor our marketing to your needs and to improve our website for future customers.  The specific purposes for which we may process information, and the lawful basis on which we do so in each case, are set out below.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tailoring this website to your needs</strong></p>
                        <p>We want to make our website easy to personalise.  We use preference cookies to store your preferences, such as website language selection, so that you do not need to make the same selections every time you visit our website.  These cookies, stored by your browser on your device, will retain your preference choices [for 30 days, until you delete them].  We record your consent to store cookies when you first visit the site and click on the cookie notice, and we provide details of how to change your settings <Link to="/cookie-policy/">HERE</Link></p>

                        <p><strong>Improving the effectiveness of our website</strong></p>
                        <p>We want to make sure that our website enables people to learn about the show and to book tickets and that the site meets the needs of our customers and is easy to use. To do this, we need to understand how people use this site, where they spend time and which pages they find less useful.  We use Google Analytics platform to understand how you and other visitors use our website, for example recording in what order pages are visited and how long is spent on each, so that we may improve the website in future. [Google Analytics platform’s privacy policy may be found <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>].  We record your consent to store site analytics cookies when you first visit the site and click on the cookie notice.

                        <p><strong>Targeting and measuring the effectiveness of our digital advertising</strong></p>
                        <p>We know that many people visit a show site several times to learn about the show and dates when tickets are available before deciding to book tickets.  We want to make sure that our digital advertisements on other websites and social media are seen by people likely to be interested in the show, including by visitors to this site who have not yet booked. We also want to understand the effectiveness of our advertising in encouraging visits to the website and ticket bookings so that we may improve it in future for example by reviewing the choice of advertising design and the websites and advertising networks used to reach possible customers. Achieving this may involve showing different versions of advertisements to different customers to measure the responses generated by each. We may use available browsing history, including visits to this website, to identify people to whom we wish to show advertisements on websites operated by third parties and to record how many visitors are referred to our site from other sites.  We use Sizmek advertising tracking cookies to achieve this and process these cookies on the basis of legitimate interest. We believe that showing relevant advertisements is in your interest as well as ours and we do not believe that such personalisation is generally considered intrusive.] We respect any decision not to participate in personalised advertising, in which case third party sites may show you non-personalised advertising and you may still see advertisements for our show. We record your consent to store advertising tracking cookies when you first visit the site and click on the cookie notice. Details of how to change your settings to opt out of personalised advertising may be found <a href="./cookies">HERE</a>. We use Sizmek to track our advertising. Details of how long your data is stored and how transfers outside the EEA are protected may be found in their <a href="https://www.sizmek.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.  Our tracking cookie information is not shared with third parties for their own use, though we may use it to reconcile advertising costs with the publishers of third party sites. </p>

                        <p>The personal information collected while you use this website may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may happen, for example, when the computer servers used to host the website or our advertising and marketing systems are located in a country outside the EEA. If we transfers your personal information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be appropriately protected.</p>
